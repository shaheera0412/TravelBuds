# Final Capstone Project - E-Commerce Travel and Tours Website

Welcome to our final capstone project developed during the Zuitt Main Course Coding Bootcamp. In this project, I've built upon the foundation of the backend server created in the second capstone project. I have now developed a front-end client user interface that seamlessly integrates with the backend server. This interface facilitates user interactions and connections to the database. The project is built using the following frameworks: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

## Project Overview

This project represents a fully functional e-commerce travel and tours website. Users can access a wide range of available travel destinations, which are retrieved directly from the database. The website also offers features such as user registration, login, tour booking, and much more. It is important to note that while the website offers a booking experience, any payment and financial transactions are simulated and not actually processed.

## Contact and Future Development

If you're interested in purchasing this website or collaborating on its further development, please feel free to reach out to me through my contact page. I'm open to discussing and making arrangements for taking this project to the next level.
